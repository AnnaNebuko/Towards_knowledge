All the weird and unnecessary logic tasks that I'm lucky enough to come across

***CountPairsInArray:***
Count the pairs in the array
int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,5,6,6};

***CountTheSameLettersInARow:***
Show how many repeated letters follow each other
Input: "aaaabbbcca"
Output: (a, 4), (b, 3), (c, 2), (a, 1)
